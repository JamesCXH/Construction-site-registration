# Construction-site-registration

flite file too large for github, but it can be generated by the ipynb

not most recent nor completed version, will update final designs as they are confirmed

facial recognition has been deleted and is currently being remade, old version was too slow for practical uses

please email jchencxh@gmail.com for a testing build (currently not operable on raspberrypi)
